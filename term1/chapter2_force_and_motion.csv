Short Answer,1,"Define displacement","Displacement is the shortest distance between the initial and final positions of an object along with direction.",
Short Answer,2,"What is uniform velocity?","When an object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time along a straight line, it is said to be in uniform velocity.",
Short Answer,3,"Define acceleration","Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time.",
Short Answer,4,"What is the center of gravity?","The center of gravity is the point through which the entire weight of the body appears to act.",
Short Answer,5,"What is meant by stability?","Stability is the tendency of an object to maintain or restore its equilibrium when displaced from its original position.",
Long Answer,1,"Write the differences between distance and displacement","1. Distance is the length of actual path traveled. Displacement is shortest distance between initial and final positions. 2. Distance is a scalar quantity. Displacement is a vector quantity. 3. Distance can never be zero for a moving body. Displacement can be zero even after traveling a distance. 4. Distance is always positive. Displacement can be positive, negative or zero.",
Long Answer,2,"Explain the three types of equilibrium with examples","1. Stable Equilibrium: Object returns to original position when displaced slightly (e.g., pendulum at rest). 2. Unstable Equilibrium: Object moves further away when displaced slightly (e.g., pencil balanced on its tip). 3. Neutral Equilibrium: Object remains in new position when displaced (e.g., sphere on horizontal surface).",
Numerical,1,"Geetha takes 15 minutes from her house to reach her school on a bicycle. If the bicycle has a speed of 2 m/s, calculate the distance between her house and the school.","Distance = Speed × time = 2 × 900 = 1800 m","Given: time = 15 min = 900 sec, Speed = 2 m/s"
Numerical,2,"A car started from rest and traveling with velocity of 20 m/s in 10 s. What is its acceleration?","Acceleration = (20 - 0)/10 = 2 m/s²","Given: Initial velocity = 0 m/s, Final velocity = 20 m/s, Time = 10s"
