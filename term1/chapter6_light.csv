Fill in the Blanks,1,"The bouncing back of light rays from a surface is called _____","reflection",
Fill in the Blanks,2,"The angle between the incident ray and the normal is called _____","angle of incidence",
Fill in the Blanks,3,"The image formed by a plane mirror is _____ the size of the object","equal to",
Fill in the Blanks,4,"Light travels at a speed of _____ meters per second in vacuum","3 × 10⁸",
Fill in the Blanks,5,"A _____ is used to split white light into its constituent colors","prism",
True/False,1,"The Moon is a luminous object","False","The Moon is a non-luminous object as it reflects the light of the Sun"
True/False,2,"The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection","True",
True/False,3,"A plane mirror forms a real image","False","A plane mirror always forms a virtual image"
True/False,4,"Light can travel through a vacuum","True",
True/False,5,"The image formed in a plane mirror appears to be at the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front of it","True",
Short Answer,1,"Define reflection of light","When light falls on any surface, it bounces back into the same medium. This phenomenon is called reflection of light.",
Short Answer,2,"State the laws of reflection","1. The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection 2. The incident ray, the normal at the point of incidence, and the reflected ray all lie in the same plane.",
Short Answer,3,"What is lateral inversion?","The phenomenon in which the right side of an object appears as the left side and vice versa in an image is called lateral inversion.",
Short Answer,4,"Distinguish between luminous and non-luminous objects","Luminous objects emit their own light (e.g., Sun, stars, flame). Non-luminous objects do not emit light but reflect light falling on them (e.g., Moon, planets, book).",
Long Answer,1,"Explain the formation of shadows with necessary conditions","1. Light travels in straight lines 2. An opaque object is needed to block light 3. A source of light and a screen are required 4. The shadow is always formed on the opposite side of the light source 5. The size of shadow depends on: a) The distance between the source and object b) The distance between the object and screen",
Long Answer,2,"Describe the dispersion of white light through a prism","1. White light is composed of seven colors (VIBGYOR) 2. When white light passes through a prism, it splits into its constituent colors 3. This happens because different colors have different wavelengths 4. Red light has the longest wavelength and violet has the shortest 5. This splitting of white light is called dispersion",
Numerical,1,"A ray of light is incident on a plane mirror at an angle of 30° with the normal. What is the angle of reflection?","30°","By laws of reflection, angle of incidence = angle of reflection"
Numerical,2,"If a ray of light falls on a mirror making an angle of 35° with the mirror, what is the angle between the incident and reflected rays?","110°","Angle between rays = 180° - 2 × angle with mirror = 180° - 2 × 35° = 110°"
