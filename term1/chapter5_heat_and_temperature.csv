Fill in the Blanks,1,"Doctor uses ___ thermometer to measure the human body temperature","clinical",
Fill in the Blanks,2,"At room temperature mercury is in ___ state","liquid",
Fill in the Blanks,3,"Heat energy transfers from ___ to ___","hotter object colder object",
Fill in the Blanks,4,"-7°C temperature is ___ than 0°C temperature","less",
Fill in the Blanks,5,"The common laboratory thermometer is a ___ thermometer","mercury",
Short Answer,1,"Why do we use mercury in thermometers? Can water be used instead of mercury?","1. We use mercury in thermometers as they remain in liquid form even with a change of temperature. 2. Water cannot be used because: a) It cannot measure below 0°C and above 100°C b) Water is transparent making reading difficult c) Water wets the glass tube",
Short Answer,2,"Why do we jerk a clinical thermometer before measuring body temperature?","The jerk allows the mercury level to flow into the bulb so that the mercury level is below the normal temperature.",
Short Answer,3,"What is the use of kink in clinical thermometer?","A kink prevents the mercury from flowing back into the bulb when the thermometer is taken out of the patient's mouth so that the temperature can be noted conveniently.",
Short Answer,4,"Why can't a clinical thermometer be used to measure the temperature of hot water?","Clinical thermometer has small temperature range (35°C to 42°C). If used for hot water the glass will crack/burst due to excessive pressure created by expansion of mercury.",
Long Answer,1,"State the similarities and differences between laboratory thermometer and clinical thermometer","Similarities: 1. Both have long narrow uniform glass tubes 2. Both contain mercury 3. Both have Celsius scale. Differences: Laboratory thermometer: 1. Scaled -10°C to 110°C 2. No kink present 3. Temperature read while in source 4. No jerk needed 5. Used in laboratory. Clinical thermometer: 1. Scaled 35°C to 42°C 2. Has kink 3. Can read after removing 4. Needs jerk 5. Used for body temperature",
True/False,1,"Temperature is related to how fast the atoms within a substance are moving","True",
True/False,2,"Digital thermometers use mercury","False","Digital thermometers do not use mercury"
True/False,3,"The freezing point of alcohol is less than -100°C","True",
True/False,4,"A clinical thermometer can measure temperature of boiling water","False","Clinical thermometer can only measure between 35°C to 42°C"
Numerical,1,"Convert 40°C to Fahrenheit","104°F","Formula: F = (9C/5) + 32"
Numerical,2,"Convert 0 K to Celsius","-273°C","Formula: C = K - 273"
Numerical,3,"Convert -30°C to Kelvin","243 K","Formula: K = C + 273"
Numerical,4,"Convert 150°F to Celsius","65.9°C","Formula: C = (F-32) × 5/9"
