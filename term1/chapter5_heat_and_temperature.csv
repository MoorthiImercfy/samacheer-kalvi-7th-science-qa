Fill in the Blanks,1,"Temperature is measured in degree _____ scale","Celsius",
Fill in the Blanks,2,"Heat always flows from a _____ temperature body to a _____ temperature body","higher, lower",

Fill in the Blanks,4,"The range of a clinical thermometer is _____ to _____","35°C, 42°C",
Fill in the Blanks,5,"The kink in clinical thermometer prevents the mercury from _____ into the bulb","flowing back",
True/False,1,"Heat and temperature mean the same thing","False","Heat is a form of energy while temperature is a measure of hotness or coldness"
True/False,2,"Mercury is used in thermometers because it expands uniformly","True",
True/False,3,"Digital thermometers are more accurate than mercury thermometers","True",
True/False,4,"The clinical thermometer can measure high temperatures like 100°C","False","Clinical thermometers have a limited range from 35°C to 42°C"
True/False,5,"All substances expand on heating","True",
Short Answer,1,"Why is mercury used in thermometers?","Mercury is used in thermometers because: 1. It expands uniformly when heated 2. It does not stick to glass 3. It is easily visible due to its silvery color 4. It responds quickly to temperature changes",
Short Answer,2,"What is the function of the kink in a clinical thermometer?","The kink in a clinical thermometer prevents the mercury from flowing back into the bulb after taking temperature reading. This allows the reading to be noted even after removing the thermometer from the patient's mouth.",
Short Answer,3,"Define temperature","Temperature is a measure of the degree of hotness or coldness of a body. It determines the direction of heat flow between two bodies.",
Short Answer,4,"What is the principle behind the working of a thermometer?","Thermometers work on the principle that liquids expand when heated and contract when cooled. This expansion and contraction is uniform and can be measured on a calibrated scale.",
Short Answer,5,"Why can't we use a clinical thermometer to measure the temperature of boiling water?","A clinical thermometer cannot measure the temperature of boiling water because: 1. Its range is limited from 35°C to 42°C 2. High temperatures can damage the thermometer 3. It is specifically designed for measuring body temperature",
Long Answer,1,"Compare laboratory thermometer and clinical thermometer","Laboratory Thermometer vs Clinical Thermometer:
1. Range: Lab (-10°C to 110°C), Clinical (35°C to 42°C)
2. Kink: Lab (No kink), Clinical (Has kink)
3. Scale: Lab (Long scale), Clinical (Short, precise scale)
4. Usage: Lab (General purpose), Clinical (Body temperature only)
5. Reading: Lab (Must be vertical), Clinical (Can be tilted)
6. Accuracy: Lab (±1°C), Clinical (±0.1°C)",
Long Answer,2,"Explain how heat affects the states of matter","Effects of Heat on States of Matter:
1. Solids: Particles vibrate faster, expand slightly, may melt
2. Liquids: Particles move faster, expand more than solids, may evaporate
3. Gases: Particles move much faster, expand the most
4. Changes in state occur at specific temperatures
5. Heat increases kinetic energy of particles
6. Volume changes are most noticeable in gases",
Numerical,1,"Convert 25°C to Fahrenheit. [°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32]","Step 1: °F = (25 × 9/5) + 32
Step 2: °F = 45 + 32
Step 3: °F = 77°F","Given: Temperature = 25°C"
Numerical,2,"Convert 98.6°F to Celsius. [°C = (°F - 32) × 5/9]","Step 1: °C = (98.6 - 32) × 5/9
Step 2: °C = 66.6 × 5/9
Step 3: °C = 37°C","Given: Temperature = 98.6°F"
Activity,1,"To demonstrate thermal expansion in solids","Materials needed: Metal ball and ring apparatus
Steps:
1. Pass the metal ball through the ring at room temperature
2. Heat the metal ball using a Bunsen burner
3. Try to pass the heated ball through the ring
Observation: The heated ball cannot pass through the ring
Conclusion: Solids expand on heating",
Activity,2,"To observe the expansion of water on heating","Materials needed: Flask, water, cork with glass tube
Steps:
1. Fill the flask completely with colored water
2. Insert the cork with glass tube
3. Mark the initial water level in the tube
4. Heat the flask gently
Observation: Water level in the tube rises
Conclusion: Liquids expand on heating"
