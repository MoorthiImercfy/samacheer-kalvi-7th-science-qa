Short Answer,1,"What is atomic number?","Atomic number is the number of protons an atom contains.",
Short Answer,2,"What is mass number of an atom?","It is the sum of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.",
Short Answer,3,"What is a neutron?","Neutron is an elementary particle that carries no charge.",
Short Answer,4,"Name the 3 sub-atomic particles of an atom.","Electron Proton Neutron.",
Short Answer,5,"What are valence electrons?","The number of electrons present in the outermost shell of an atom are known as valence electrons.",
Long Answer,1,"What was the model of an atom proposed by Thomson?","1. J.J. Thomson's theory proposed that the atom has positively charged part like the red part of the watermelon and in it are embedded like the seeds negatively charged particles which he called electrons. 2. According to this theory as the positive and negative charges are equal the atom as a whole does not have any resultant charge. 3. Thomson's greatest contribution was to prove by experimentation the existence of the negatively charged particles or electrons in an atom.",
Long Answer,2,"Explain proton electron and neutron.","1. Proton (p): The proton is the positively charged particle and is located in the nucleus. Its positive charge is of the same magnitude as that of the electron's negative charge. 2. Neutron (n): Neutron is inside the nucleus. The neutron does not have any charge. Except hydrogen (protium) the nuclei of all atoms contain neutrons. 3. Electron (e): This is a negatively charged particle. Electrons revolve around the nucleus of the atom in specific orbits. The mass of an electron is negligible as compared to that of a proton or neutron.",
