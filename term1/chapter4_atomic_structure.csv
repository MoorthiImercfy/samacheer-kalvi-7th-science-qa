Short Answer,1,"What is atomic number?","The atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons present in its nucleus.",
Short Answer,2,"What is mass number?","Mass number is the total number of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom.",
Short Answer,3,"Define valency","Valency is the combining capacity of an atom of an element. It is equal to the number of electrons in the outermost shell or the number of electrons lost, gained, or shared to achieve a stable electronic configuration.",
Short Answer,4,"Name the three sub-atomic particles","The three sub-atomic particles are: 1. Protons (positive charge) 2. Neutrons (neutral) 3. Electrons (negative charge).",
Short Answer,5,"What are valence electrons?","Valence electrons are the electrons present in the outermost shell of an atom. They determine the chemical properties of the element.",
Long Answer,1,"Explain Thomson's atomic model","1. J.J. Thomson proposed that an atom is a sphere of positive charge. 2. The electrons are embedded in it like plums in a pudding. 3. The positive and negative charges are equal, making atom neutral. 4. This model explained that atoms are electrically neutral. 5. However, it couldn't explain certain properties of atoms.",
Long Answer,2,"Describe the three sub-atomic particles in detail","1. Proton: Positively charged particle located in nucleus, mass = 1 amu. 2. Neutron: Neutral particle in nucleus, mass = 1 amu. 3. Electron: Negatively charged particle revolving around nucleus, mass negligible compared to proton/neutron. 4. Protons and neutrons together are called nucleons. 5. Number of protons equals number of electrons in a neutral atom.",
Numerical,1,"An atom has atomic number 9 and mass number 19. Calculate the number of neutrons.","Number of neutrons = Mass number - Atomic number = 19 - 9 = 10 neutrons","Given: Atomic number = 9, Mass number = 19"
Numerical,2,"If an atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, what is its mass number?","Mass number = Number of protons + Number of neutrons = 8 + 8 = 16","Given: Protons = 8, Neutrons = 8"
